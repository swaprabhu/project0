<p>
  &emsp;With good eater, parents are happy with their toddler's food intake. They will have regular routine of food (Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with a midmorning snack and a midafternoon snack) and right amount of nutrients. By now, they should be eating, not drinking, their way through the day. So if you are toddler falls into a good eater, just explore more variety of foods. But, be careful with chocking foods and allegertic foods.

<h3 id="Moderate_Eater"> Moderate eater </h3>
<p>
  &emsp;With the moderate eater, they are also called as Picky eaters, they eat foods which they like. picky eaters only comes after the baby turns to 1 year. they like only some kind of taste, or some kind foods. this leads to poor nutrition. For ex: If a toddler likes sugar taste, only having sugary foods which is not good for health. So parents should consider the nutrition part very seriously. You can give food whatever toddler like but in small portion. So that toddler should know get use to other foods. Often check the weights. So that you can understand the toddlers health and foods. Take advice from doctor if you not satisfied with the food intake of your child.
